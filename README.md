# Identification and Discrimination of PRecipitation Objects (ID-PRO)
#
## Description

This program ID-PRO takes a two-dimensional field of any size, calculates a background field, and then identifies locally enhanced features from that field.

## Synthetically Generated Fields

Four different 601x601-pixel fields at 2-km grid spacing of varying complexity were generated, matching the same size as the 1201x1201 km NCState radar domain. The four idealized fields consist of uniform ellipses corresponding to 100-200 km length bands (F1), the same ellipses but with an additional inner core of higher reflectivity added (F2), a field with both long ellipses (corresponding to > 200 km length bands), small cells (corresponding to < 100 km diameter), and irregularly shaped objects (F3), some complex, low-reflectivity connected ellipses and inner cores lying in a low-reflectivity background (F4), and a higher intensity version of F4 (F5).
